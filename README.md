# CrossSight👁️📝 - Image Captioning
A Multimodal Image Captioning System Built From Scratch using PyTorch

CrossSight is an End-to-End Image Captioning System that learns to **see** images and **generates** captions using CNN Encoder and Transformer Based Auto-Regressive Decoder.

The entire architecture is built from scratch using PyTorch , from attention mechanisms - to inference-time decoding , and is Deployed as an interactive web demo using Gradio. 

## 💻 Demo:
